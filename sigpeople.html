                <p > The year 1822 birth a woman destined to make significant changes in society. That woman was named Araminta Ross, later to be infamously known as Harriet Tubman. Young Araminta was born as an African-American slave, forced into labour under brutal white supremacy conditions. On her way to a local grocer, Harriet mistakenly was hit by a two-pound weight. This incident resulted in her becoming diagnosed with narcolepsy, a sleeping disorder causing several conditions such as excessive sleeping and sleep paralysis. At the time, this was better known as "sleeping spells". As a result, slave buyers were not interested in her when her current buyer at the time was trying to sell her; thus, her father took her in to do lumber work. </p> 
                <h2 class="sigpeopleh2" > Her Work </h2>
                <p > Working in lumber exposed Harriet to communication with free black sailors whom she heard about an underground railroad where people of homes, boats, and wagons were waiting for black fugitives to take them up north and then Canada — liberation. After two attempts, Harriet earns confirmation of the route. Thanks to this knowledge, Harriet was able to transport her friends, family, and others to Pennsylvania and eventually to Canada. </p>
                <p>In 1863, Harriet became known to be the first woman in U.S. history to host a military raid, which resulted in freeing almost 700 salves in South Carolina.</p>
                <p>Harriet continued her work for justice by raising funds for new schools and hospitals accessible for anyone.</p> 
                <p>In 1888, her fame for women's equality and rights grew. She spoke in many organizations and movements, including her appearance in 1896 in Washington D.C. at the National Association of Colored Women.</p>
                <p>Harriet Tubman had a long waiting request to obtain a veteran pension. Thanks to the mass number of supporters she earned through the remarkable change she made in society, she was able to be granted a pension of $20/month. In respect and honour to this, it was since 2016 when the American $20 bill would Harriet Tubman on the bill's front.</p>
                <p>Harriet Tubman passed at the age of 91-year-old on March 10, 1913, with her final words: "I go, prepare a place for you." </p>

                <p> A woman of the name Isabella Baumfree was born in 1797 in Rifton, New York, United States of America. She was born into a family of slaves; however, during a time when the emancipation act was gradual. African-Americans were required to be slaves until their mid 20's rather than their whole lives. Nonetheless, when living a slave's life, she was bound to lose her family after being traded so many times. Eventually, she eloped with an enslaved man named Thomas, whom she had three kids.</p> 
                <p> The slow act of abolition threatened to keep her family together. After promising her freedom in 1826 yet failed to keep that promise, Isabella fled for her life with the only child she could rescue, her youngest daughter, Sophia. In 1828, Isabella fought her way through court, with no legal system knowledge, to claim back her illegally traded son peter. She raised funds, strategized with lawyers, and believed in her faith, resulting in Peter's return in 1828.  Isabella was able to follow these procedures to get back her eldest daughter in 1830. Little did she know, her remarkable road to justice was about to begin. </p>
                <h2 class="sigpeopleh2" > Her Work </h2>
                <p> Isabella became dedicated to her faith. She joined a methodist community in Kingston, New York, who shared similar political views. She would continue her discussions with God in private. On a fateful night, God told Isabella to leave Kingston and spread her sermons to the public. They spoke of the oppression against black people and unjustice for women. Isabella changed her name to what she is more commonly known as in modern-day, Sojourner Truth in 1843. </p>
                <p> Truth's speeches impacted both black and whites. Although she was threatened by many, both verbally and physically, her faith in God protected her. She later became active in the union army during the civil war. She scouted men and supplied the black troops. Her work awed Lincoln, which motivated him to speak to her. She took this opportunity to tell him that all formally enslaved people should be granted land from the government. </p>
                <p> Truth passed in 1883 as a holy spirit. She leaves a powerful message that should be heard by all, "I feel safe in the midst of my enemies, for the truth is all powerful and will prevail.". </p>

                <p> It was a relatively sunny day on March 2, 1955, in Montgomery, Alabama, of the United States. The era where bus segregation was present, reserving the majority of the whites' seats and a few for the blacks at the back. A young white woman boards a bus where it was full. However, she noticed some black people at the back seatings. Thus, she demanded all of them to remove themselves to make room for her. Three of the four moved, however, one person remain seated. No, this is not the story of the infamous Mrs. Rosa Parks. This was the story of the young 15-year-old Claudette Colvin, nine months prior to Rosa Parks's incident.  </p> 
                <h2 class="sigpeopleh2" > Her Work </h2>
                <p> Claudette was forcefully taken away by the Alabama cops. She was put not in juvenile prison, yet in the city jail, where her mother would later pick her up. She was charged and convicted of assault and battery, disorderly conduct, and violating city ordinance. </p>
                <p> When asked what motivated her to do what she did, replied with her iconic quote, I felt like Sojourner Truth was pushing down on one shoulder, and Harriet Tubman was pushing down on the other, saying, 'Sit down girl!' I was glued to my seat.".  </p>
                <p> Claudette Colvin reminds the youth that you are never too young to make a change for the better.  </p>

                <p> On March 24/25, 1944, two young white girls were missing in Columbia, South Carolina, United States, after they searched for pretty flowers. George Stinney was a young black boy who was last seen having a small interaction with the two missing girls. Due to this interaction, the community decided to point fingers at him. Stinney was on a two hour trial for the first-degree murder of the two white girls. It only took a mere ten minutes by an all-white jury to convict George Stinney for first-degree-murder without listening to his appeal. In that same year, the execution for Stinney occurred via an electric chair. It was not until 2014, 70 years after the trial when George Stinney was proven innocent.  </p> 
                <p> The story of George Stinney continues to this day, unfortunately. The  "I can't breathe" statement comes from the last words of Eric Garner, a victim of police brutality specifically against African-Americans. These incidents prove that racism truly is in the system, which is further the reason why action must transpire.  </p>

                <p> In Merrit College, Oakland California, "Pioneer Day" celebrated the pioneers who immigrated to California during the 1800s however omitted the fact that African Americans immigrated to west America. Huey Newton and Bobby Seale did not like this, which urged them to form the Negro History Fact Group, which served to bring light to the lack of black history in their college. The assassination of Malcolm X encouraged the two students to find the infamous Black Panthers in October of 1966.   At birth, the group's activities were primarily surveillance police actives in black communities in Oakland and others to challenge police brutality.  </p> 
                <h2 class="sigpeopleh2" > Ther Activism </h2>
                <p> The organization had a Marxist philosophy. Their philosophical and political views were based upon the Ten-Point program, which called for an end to police brutality and fights for justice. However, while portrayed as a gang, their leadership saw the organization as a political party whose aim was ascertaining more African Americans elected to political office.  </p>
                <p> Black Panthers expanded their activism by opening numerous social programs. They found out kids weren't learning in school because they are hungry; thus, they opened free breakfast programs for school children. They also created free health clinics for thirteen African-American communities in the U.S. The media attempted to spread false news about the Panthers bring anti-white. This was, in fact, the opposite. They sought help and cooperated with some white grocery owners to donate foods for their breakfast programs and help from doctors and medical students for the medical care programs.  </p>
